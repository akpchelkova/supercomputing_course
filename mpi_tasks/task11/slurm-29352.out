=== Cartesian Grid Communication ===
Total processes: 9
Grid dimensions: 3 x 3
Process 6 (world 6) -> Grid coordinates: (2, 0)
Process 7 (world 7) -> Grid coordinates: (2, 1)
Process 8 (world 8) -> Grid coordinates: (2, 2)
Process 0 (world 0) -> Grid coordinates: (0, 0)
Process 1 (world 1) -> Grid coordinates: (0, 1)
Process 2 (world 2) -> Grid coordinates: (0, 2)
Process 3 (world 3) -> Grid coordinates: (1, 0)
Process 4 (world 4) -> Grid coordinates: (1, 1)
Process 5 (world 5) -> Grid coordinates: (1, 2)
Process (0,0): row_rank=0/3, col_rank=0/3

=== Testing Collective Operations ===
Data size: 1000 doubles, Iterations: 100
Process (0,1): row_rank=1/3, col_rank=0/3
Process (0,2): row_rank=2/3, col_rank=0/3
Process (1,0): row_rank=0/3, col_rank=1/3
Process (1,1): row_rank=1/3, col_rank=1/3
Process (2,2): row_rank=2/3, col_rank=2/3
Process (2,0): row_rank=0/3, col_rank=2/3
Process (2,1): row_rank=1/3, col_rank=2/3
Process (1,2): row_rank=2/3, col_rank=1/3

=== Performance Results ===
WORLD Bcast:    0.001712 seconds
ROW Bcast:      0.000984 seconds
Ratio (WORLD/ROW): 1.74

WORLD Reduce:   0.003278 seconds
COL Reduce:     0.002439 seconds
Ratio (WORLD/COL): 1.34

=== Summary ===
Sub-communicators (rows/columns) are 1.3-1.7 times faster than WORLD communicator
