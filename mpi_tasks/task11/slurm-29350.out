=== Cartesian Grid Communication ===
Total processes: 4
Grid dimensions: 2 x 2
Process 1 (world 1) -> Grid coordinates: (0, 1)
Process (0,1): row_rank=1/2, col_rank=0/2
Process 2 (world 2) -> Grid coordinates: (1, 0)
Process (1,0): row_rank=0/2, col_rank=1/2
Process 3 (world 3) -> Grid coordinates: (1, 1)
Process (1,1): row_rank=1/2, col_rank=1/2
Process 0 (world 0) -> Grid coordinates: (0, 0)
Process (0,0): row_rank=0/2, col_rank=0/2

=== Testing Collective Operations ===
Data size: 1000 doubles, Iterations: 100

=== Performance Results ===
WORLD Bcast:    0.001125 seconds
ROW Bcast:      0.000529 seconds
Ratio (WORLD/ROW): 2.13

WORLD Reduce:   0.001697 seconds
COL Reduce:     0.000528 seconds
Ratio (WORLD/COL): 3.21

=== Summary ===
Sub-communicators (rows/columns) are 2.1-3.2 times faster than WORLD communicator
