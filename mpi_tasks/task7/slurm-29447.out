=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 500000 us, Comm size: 500000000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.5002s, comm=0.4036s, total=0.9038s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 9.7290 s
Total compute time: 5.0016 s
Total communication time: 0.9948 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 5.9964 s
Overlap efficiency: 61.6%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
