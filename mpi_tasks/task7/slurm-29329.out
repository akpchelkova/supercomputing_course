=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000, Iterations: 5
Processes: 4, Local compute: 500000 us, Comm size: 500 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.5002s, comm=0.0000s, total=0.5002s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 2.5010 s
Total compute time: 2.5009 s
Total communication time: 0.0000 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 2.5009 s
Overlap efficiency: 100.0%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
