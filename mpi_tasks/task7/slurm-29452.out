=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 0.10 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 25000 us, Comm size: 25000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.0252s, comm=0.0001s, total=0.0253s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 0.2523 s
Total compute time: 0.2517 s
Total communication time: 0.0004 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 0.2521 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
