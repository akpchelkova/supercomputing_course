=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 8.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 2000000 us, Comm size: 2000000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=2.0002s, comm=0.0018s, total=2.0020s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 20.0247 s
Total compute time: 20.0017 s
Total communication time: 0.0103 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 20.0119 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
