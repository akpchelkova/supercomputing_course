=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 4.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 1000000 us, Comm size: 1000000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=1.0002s, comm=0.0012s, total=1.0014s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 10.0198 s
Total compute time: 10.0017 s
Total communication time: 0.0075 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 10.0092 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
