=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 1.50 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 375000 us, Comm size: 375000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.3752s, comm=0.0004s, total=0.3756s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 3.7565 s
Total compute time: 3.7517 s
Total communication time: 0.0023 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 3.7540 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
