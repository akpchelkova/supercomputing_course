=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000000, Iterations: 5
Processes: 4, Local compute: 500000 us, Comm size: 500000000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.5002s, comm=0.3806s, total=0.8808s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 4.7632 s
Total compute time: 2.5007 s
Total communication time: 1.5849 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 4.0856 s
Overlap efficiency: 85.8%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
