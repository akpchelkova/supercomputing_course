=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 5
Processes: 16, Local compute: 125000 us, Comm size: 125000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.1252s, comm=0.0003s, total=0.1255s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 0.6424 s
Total compute time: 0.6256 s
Total communication time: 0.0008 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 0.6264 s
Overlap efficiency: 97.5%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
