=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 3.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 750000 us, Comm size: 750000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.7502s, comm=0.0007s, total=0.7509s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 7.5105 s
Total compute time: 7.5015 s
Total communication time: 0.0034 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 7.5049 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
