=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 16, Local compute: 125000 us, Comm size: 125000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.1252s, comm=0.0002s, total=0.1254s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 1.2540 s
Total compute time: 1.2516 s
Total communication time: 0.0011 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 1.2527 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
