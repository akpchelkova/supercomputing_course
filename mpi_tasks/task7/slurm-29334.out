=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 5
Processes: 8, Local compute: 250000 us, Comm size: 250000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.2502s, comm=0.0004s, total=0.2506s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 1.2529 s
Total compute time: 1.2507 s
Total communication time: 0.0013 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 1.2520 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
