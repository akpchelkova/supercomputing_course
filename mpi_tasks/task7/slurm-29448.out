=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 2, Local compute: 1000000 us, Comm size: 1000000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=1.0002s, comm=0.0007s, total=1.0009s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 10.0095 s
Total compute time: 10.0017 s
Total communication time: 0.0031 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 10.0047 s
Overlap efficiency: 100.0%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
