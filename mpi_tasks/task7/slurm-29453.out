=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 0.20 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 50000 us, Comm size: 50000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.0502s, comm=0.0001s, total=0.0503s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 0.5027 s
Total compute time: 0.5017 s
Total communication time: 0.0005 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 0.5022 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
