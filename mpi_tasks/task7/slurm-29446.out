=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 2.00 s, Bytes/sec: 100000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 500000 us, Comm size: 50000000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.5002s, comm=0.0379s, total=0.5381s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 5.4751 s
Total compute time: 5.0015 s
Total communication time: 0.0873 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 5.0889 s
Overlap efficiency: 92.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
