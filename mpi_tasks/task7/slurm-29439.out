=== Non-blocking Balance Experiment ===
Total compute: 1.00 s, Bytes/sec: 1000000, Iterations: 10
Processes: 4, Local compute: 250000 us, Comm size: 250000 bytes
Iteration 0: compute=0.2502s, comm=0.0003s, total=0.2505s

=== RESULTS ===
Total time: 2.5050 s
Total compute time: 2.5016 s
Total communication time: 0.0014 s
Ideal time (compute + comm): 2.5030 s
Overlap efficiency: 99.9%
Compute-bound: communications are well hidden
